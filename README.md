# Algorithmic_Trading

Â Python application serving as a quick and dirty prototype to use quantitive security analysis & Monte Carlo simulation to identify potentially profitable stock trades and place order in Alpaca Paper Trading Account directly via API.

In the future, more parts can be gradually added to this prototype such as: connecting with Database/SQL, using AI / machine-learning to identify potentially profitable trades, expanding to crypto & futures/options trading etc

The ultimate goal is to build a paper trading verified algorithmic trading application for realtime trading (for example connecting with Robin-hood live trading act)
